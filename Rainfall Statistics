# Modify the program so that the rainfall for each month is stored into a list. Eliminate the user's
# ability to select the number of years, you will just work with one year's data.   The program
# should calculate and display the total rainfall for the year, the average monthly rainfall the year,
# and the months with the highest and lowest amounts of rain for the year. Hint: convert months
# to a list so you can use the index value to print the max and min months.
