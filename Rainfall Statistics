# Modify the program so that the rainfall for each month is stored into a list. Eliminate the user's ability to select
# the number of years, you will just work with one year's data.   The program should calculate and display the
# total rainfall for the year, the average monthly rainfall the year, and the months with the highest and lowest
# amounts of rain for the year. Hint: convert months to a list so you can use the index value to print the max
# and min months.
