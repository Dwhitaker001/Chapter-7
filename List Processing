# 1. Have a function that creates a list of 20 random integers between 1 and 100 (Assign them
# dynamically, store the list in a variable.)
# 2. Have a function get a number from the user that is between 1 and 100. Use a try-except
# statement to validate that an integer is entered. Place the try-except statement inside a
# while loop that validates that the value is between 1 and 100.
# 3. Pass both the list and the user's number to a function and have it display all numbers in the
# list that are greater than the user's number. If there are not any, display a message that
# explains there are no numbers in the list greater than the entered number.
