# The following two files contain names of popular Boy's names and popular Girl's names. Download
# them and add them to your project file.
# Then, write a program that reads the contents of the two files into two separate lists. The user
# should be able to enter a boy's name or a girl's name. The application should check both lists, and
# then display messages indicating whether the names were among the most popular if the name was
# on one of the lists or that the name was not on the lists of popular names.
